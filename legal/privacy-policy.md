Last updated: February 9, 2026

## Overview

PII Prompt Shield is a Chrome extension designed to help users avoid accidentally submitting personal or sensitive information to AI chat interfaces.

This Privacy Policy explains what data the extension processes, how it is used, and what permissions are required.

## Data Processing

PII Prompt Shield processes prompt text locally in your browser to detect potential sensitive information before submission.

- Prompt text is analyzed on-device.
- Prompt text is not sent to servers operated by the extension developer.

## Data Collection

The extension stores only user configuration settings using Chrome extension storage, such as:

- Enabled/disabled state
- Detection mode and sensitivity preferences
- Trusted site list

If Chrome Sync is enabled in your browser, these settings may sync through your Google account according to Chrome's own policies.

## Permissions Used

PII Prompt Shield uses the following permissions:

- `storage`: to save user preferences and trusted site settings.
- `tabs`: to read the hostname of the currently active tab when you use the "Trust Current Site" action.
- Host access (manifest match patterns): to run the content script on supported AI domains and check prompts before submission.

## Data Sharing

PII Prompt Shield does not share your prompt text or settings with third parties.

## Data Retention

Settings remain stored in Chrome extension storage until you:

- Change or clear them,
- Uninstall the extension, or
- Clear browser extension data.

## Security

PII Prompt Shield is designed to minimize data exposure by processing prompt content locally in the browser.

## Children's Privacy

PII Prompt Shield is not directed to children under 13, and no intentional collection of children's personal information is performed.

## Changes to This Policy
